# biasmonitor

A Python application for running crude comparisons between user data for two Spotify listeners.

The plan is to later embed this app into RecordWrong.com to let people compare their tastes with that of the critics. Rather than avoiding personal biases in writing, I think it would be more interesting to embrace them.
